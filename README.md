# My Personal Site

Hi everyone!

This is my personal site built using react and react bootstrap, I built this site entirely on GitHub Codespaces by forking the codespaces-react repo. I also used Google Sheets as an api to update the site. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages at <https://megan-o.github.io/site/>.


#### Usual React Stuff...

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the built-in Simple Browser (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P > Simple Browser: Show`) to view your running application.

The page will reload automatically when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
